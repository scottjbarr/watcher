# Watcher

Watches a directory for changes, and runs a command when changes to
any *.go file is detected.

It isn't particularly polished, but it works.

## Usage

    Usage of watcher:
      -c string
            command to execute on change (default "go test")
      -d string
            directory to watch (default ".")
